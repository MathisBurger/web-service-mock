# Project information

This project is a simple web api mock service. I built it to simulate some simple
API calls and the json responses of them. Even if there are better solutions out there, I just 
wanted to create my own solution, because I wanted to use some more kotlin in my personal projects.

# User interface

The API endpoints are configured with a simple `yaml` config file that contains the informarion
about the routes and their responses.

# Techstack

This project uses kotlin with spring boot. I have chosen this techstack, because I have never
worked with it before. At least not that close. Even if this project is not that big and does not have 
database support it was a great experience.

# Installation

Just do not install it. It is built to work with kotlin and spring and should 
not be used in any way.

# Purpose

This project does not follow a commercial purpose. It is just a simple project
to get myself into kotlin and spring. I stopped working with databases and users because 
in my opinion this is a big overhead for this small project. Because I will stick
with other programming languages and frameworks I think it is not necessary to dive more
deep into the framework.
